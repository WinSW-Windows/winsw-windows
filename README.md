## Getting Started

### Using WinSW as a Global Tool:
1. Download WinSW.exe or WinSW.zip from the distribution.
2. Create a configuration file named myapp.xml (refer to the XML configuration specification and examples for details).
3. Install the service by running the command: `bash winsw install myapp.xml`
4. Start the service using: `bash winsw start myapp.xml`  
5. Check the status of the service by executing: `bash winsw status myapp.xml`  

### Using WinSW as a Bundled Tool:
1. Obtain `WinSW.exe` or `WinSW.zip` from the distribution and rename the executable (e.g., `myapp.exe`) to match your application.
2. Create a configuration file named `myapp.xml` (refer to the XML configuration specification and samples).
3. Place both the renamed executable and the configuration file in the same directory; WinSW identifies its configuration file based on this placement.
4. Install the service by running: `bash myapp.exe install`  
5. Start the service by executing: `bash myapp.exe start`  

With its flexibility and advanced capabilities, WinSW simplifies converting executables into services, making it an efficient tool for managing custom applications on Windows platforms.
